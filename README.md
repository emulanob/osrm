docker projects

this repo contains a Dockerfile that creates a docker image based on the OSRM-Backend server (https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend), and loads the Berlin dataset by default when launched. This means that the entire test described on the project homepage is now contained in this Dockerfile ready to be built and launched.

Thanks.
